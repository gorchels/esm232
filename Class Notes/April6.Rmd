-Focus on units and document clearly
-Use best practices in code developemet
  -Organize!
  -Hierarchy helps make testing and identifying errors easier
  -Before coding, start by writing down your goal and how you will use the inputs and outputs 

-when you put information into function, it will assume the same order as the parameters required 
-putting functions in R is part of the architecture that helps you build a package 
-result only exists inside of the function, for example okun will be the variable name not result 
  -useful because it does not overwrite functions in your workspace
-give functions names that are unique

Error checking
mapply and sapply make it so you can run dataframe data in your model and give you a column for your model's output. See code!
